//Complete the instructions for each numbered problem 

//1. data types built-in methods, variables 

//a. define a variable and give it a string value
variable = "Hi i'm a variable";
//b. define a variable and give it a number value
num=200;
//c. define a variable and give it a boolean value
variable= true;
//2. if else, ternary 
//a. define a variable 'metrocard' and give it a value of 5
metrocard=5;
//b. write an if statement that has a condition to check if the value of metro card is greater than 2.75, and display the message "you have enough to ride the train", if the condition is true
if(metrocard>2.75){ console.log("You may pass the finish line!") }  // console.log("you have enough to ride the train")
//c.write an else statement that displays the message "you do not have enough to pay fare sorry"
else(console.log("you do not have enough to pay fare sorry"))
//d. write the above if/else statement again as a ternary 
if(metrocard ? '4.00' : '2.75' ){ console.log("Checking balance.....2.75 has been deducted.") }
//3. conditionals 2 (1 pt)
//a.  complete this codecademy project: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/projects/magic-eight-ball-1 
//add a screenshot showing your completion of this project to the root folder of this repo

//4. functions 
//a. write a function named helloWorld that returns the value 'Hello World!' 
function HelloWorld(){
   console.log("Hello World!")
}
//b. console log the value returned from running the function helloWorld
HelloWorld();

//3. arrays
//a. define a variable myArray and assign it to a value of an array. Give the array at least 5 elements
myArray=["Manuel","Wren","Bryan","Isaac","Who?"] 
//b. an array's index starts at: 0
//
//4. loops 
//a. write a for loop that console logs even numbers starting at 10 and decrementing to 0 
for (i=10;i>=0;i--){
    if(i%2==0){
      console.log(i);
    }
}
//5. objects
//a. define a variable named 'bike' 
let bike

//b. assign an object to bike 
 bike={}
//c. give the object 3 properties: handlebars, color, wheels 
bike["frame"]="";
bike["trim"]="";
bike["wheels"]="";
//d. give each property a value 
bike.trim="gray";
bike.frame="titanium";
bike.wheels="XL";
console.log(bike)
//6. Chessboard
/*Write a function that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
read and refer to https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html  there are hints at the bottom of the page
